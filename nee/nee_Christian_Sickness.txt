“Out of the spoil won in battles did they dedicate to repair the house of Jehovah.” 1 Chronicles 26:27

There are Christians whose experiences and whose history with God contribute immensely to the enrichment of his people. Many sicknesses of his children are for the wealth of the Church; many sufferings and difficulties and frustrations bring to it great increase.

There was a sister in Christ who had been bedridden for forty years, during thirty-five of which she had been also cut off by deafness. To a servant of God visiting her she said, "Formerly I was very active, running hither and thither, doing a lot; but I did not help to fulfill the many needs of prayer in the Church. Then that all changed. Throughout these forty years in bed, I have been able daily to engage in the work of prayer. I have no regrets."

Distress and limitation had enlarged her and made her rich, and her richness had fed wealth to the Church. How many more there are who are situated like her! We do well to thank God for them.
