"Draw me; we will run after thee." Song of Songs 1:4

Our spiritual energy in following Christ springs from more than inward impulse, even by the indwelling Spirit. It results rather from some power drawing us to him as the Spirit makes him more real and precious to us through the Word.

Far beyond our experience, we are given new revelations of the beauty and majesty of our Lord, and as a consequence are pulled by an irresistible longing to approach ever closer to him.

Notice the effect that such a devoted following of Christ has upon others. It is I who am drawn, but it is we who run after him. In other words, there is something contagious and inspiring about a Christ-dominated life. What a privilege to be so drawn by his love that we influence others to run after the Lord in pursuit of their own closer walk with him!
