When believers touch Christ, they touch the reality of all spiritual matters and things, and when believers gain Him, they gain everything that God has prepared for those who love Him. In Christ Is All Spiritual Matters and Things Watchman Nee enlightens believers to see that without a vision of the all-inclusive Christ, even their most sincere seeking after God can be misdirected toward gaining good teachings, positive virtues, and spiritual growth, all of which can be apart from the Christ who is the way, the truth, and the reality.
