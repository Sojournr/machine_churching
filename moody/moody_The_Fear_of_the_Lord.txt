The Fear of the Lord



"The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge." He who does not trust in God, knows nothing yet as he ought to know. His knowledge is partial and distorted. Whatever acquisitions in science he may attain, if his heart depart from the Living God, he abides an ignorant man.  He who in his heart says, "No God. " is a fool, however wise he may be in the estimation of the world, and his own.
