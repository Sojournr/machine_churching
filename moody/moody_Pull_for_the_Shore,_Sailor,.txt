A vessel was wrecked off the shore. Eager eyes were watching and strong arms manned the life-boat. For hours they tried to reach that vessel through the great breakers that raged and foamed on the sand-bank, but it seemed impossible. The boat appeared to be leaving the crew to perish. But after a while the captain and sixteen men were taken off, and the vessel went down. "When the life-boat came to you," said a friend, "did you expect it had brought some tools to repair your old ship?" "O, no," was the response; "she was a total wreck. Two of her masts were gone, and if we had stayed mending her, only a few minutes, we must have gone down, sir." "When once off the old wreck, and safe in the life-boat, what remained for you to do?" "Nothing, sir, but just to pull for the shore."

    Light in the darkness, sailor, day is at hand!
    See o'er the foaming billows fair haven's land,
    Drear was the voyage, sailor, now almost o'er,
    Safe within the life-boat, sailor, pull for the shore.

CHO.Pull for the shore, sailor, pull for the shore!
                Heed not the rolling waves, but bend to the oar;
                Safe in the life-boat, sailor, cling to self no more!
                Leave the poor old stranded wreck, and pull for the shore.

   Trust in the life-boat, sailor, all else will fail,
    Stronger the surges dash and fiercer the gale,
    Heed not the stormy winds, though loudly they roar;
    Watch the "bright morning star," and pull for the shore. CHO.

   Bright gleams the morning, sailor, lift up thy eye;
    Clouds and darkness disappearing, glory is nigh!
    Safe in the life-boat, sailor, sing evermore;
    "Glory, glory, hallelujah!" pull for the shore. CHO.
