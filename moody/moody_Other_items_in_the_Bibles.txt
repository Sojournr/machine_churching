"Truly the man of God is never so great as when he is little in his own eyes, and nevermore exalted than when he sits lowly at his Master's feet."

Many have got a justifying Christ; they have the Christ who died on the board; they fully believe in His blessed atonement, but they have not got the risen, reigning, sanctifying One, who can still the storm, who can control and rule; One, who when the tempter is rising suddenly, can put His hand upon it and prevent it from rising. One who can speak, and so bring in a great calm. Oh! the calm of the ruling presence of Christ.
