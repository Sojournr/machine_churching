A lady once told me she was in her pantry on one occasion, and she was surprised by the ringing of a bell. As she whirled around to see what it was, she broke a tumbler. Her little child was standing there, and she thought her mother was doing a very correct thing, and the moment the lady left the pantry, the child commenced to break all the tumblers she could get hold of. You may laugh, but children are very good imitators. If you don't want them to break the Sabbath day, keep it holy yourself. It is very often by imitation that they utter their first oath; that they tell their first lie, and it grows upon them, and when they try to quit the habit, it has grown so strong upon them that they cannot do it.
