WHAT MAN THINKS                                                                                           GOD SAYS
I am not so bad as others 	There is no difference, all have sinned. (Rom 3:22)
I will do the best I can, then God will make up the rest. 	Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Eph. 2:9)
I will try and merit a place in heaven. 	Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of heaven. (John 3:3)
I will make my peace with God. 	Being justified by faith, we have peace with God. (Rom. 5:1)
I will try and feel love to God. 	We love Him because He first loved us. (1 John 4:19)
I know God is love, therefore He will overlook my sins. 	He that believeth not the Son, the wrath of God abideth on him. (John 3:36)
Perhaps there is no hell. 	The wicked shall be turned into Hell. (Psalm 9:17)
