One afternoon I noticed a lady at the services whom I knew to be a Sunday-school teacher. After the service I asked her where her class was. "O," said she, "I went to the school and found only a little boy, and so I came away." "Only a little boy!" said I. "Think of the value of one such soul! The fires of a reformation may be slumbering in that tow-headed boy; there may be a young Knox, or a Wesley, or a Whitefield in your class."
