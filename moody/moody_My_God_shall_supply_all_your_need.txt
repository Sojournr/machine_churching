Precious Jesus! I have found Thee,
All my utmost need required:
In Thyself, dear Lord, Thou'st found me,
All Thy loving heart desired.
I would praise Thee,
From my soul, by love inspired!

All my sins were laid upon Thee,
All my guilt was on Thee laid;
For the blood of Thine atonement,
All my utmost debt was paid.
Dearest Saviour,
I believe, for Thou hast said.

Both Thine arms are clasped around me,
And my head is on thy breast.
For my weary soul has found Thee
Such a perfect, perfect rest
Dearest Saviour,
Now I Know that I am blest.

Mr. Thompson
