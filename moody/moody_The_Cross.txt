While down at a convention in Illinois an old man got past seventy years; and said he remembered but one thing about his father, and that one thing followed him all through life. He could not remember his death, he had no recollection of his funeral, but he recollected his father, one winter night, taking a little chip, and with his pocket knife whittling out a little cross, and told how God in His infinite love sent His Son down here to redeem us; how He had died on the cross for us. The story of the cross followed him through life; and I tell you if you teach these children truths, they will follow them through life.
