I like to think of Christ as a burden-bearer. A minister was one day moving his library upstairs. As the minister was going upstairs with his load of books his little boy came in, and was very anxious to help his father. So his father just told him to go and get an armful and take them upstairs. When the father came back, he met the little fellow about half-way up the stairs tugging away with the biggest in the library. He couldn't manage to carry it up. The book was too big. So he sat down and cried. His father found him, and just took him in his arms, book and all, and carried him upstairs. So Christ will carry you and all your burdens.
