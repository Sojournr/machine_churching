A certain manâ€¦who never had walkedâ€¦heard Paul speak: whoâ€¦perceiving that he had faith to be healed, saidâ€¦Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. â€”Acts 14:8-10

Where true faith is, it will induce obedience and where it does induce obedience, it will always, in one form or another, bring a blessing. â€”W. Hay Aitken
