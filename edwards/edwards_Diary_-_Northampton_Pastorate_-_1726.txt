AT NORTHAMPTON PASTORATE 



Sept. 26, 1726. Tis just about three years, that I have been for the most part in a low, sunk estate and condition, miserably senseless to what I used to be about spiritual things. Twas three years ago, the week before commencement; just about the same time this year, I began to be somewhat as I used to be. 

Jan. 1728. I think Christ has recommended rising early in the morning, by his rising from the grave very early. 

Jan. 22, 1734. I judge that it is best, when I am in a good frame for divine contemplation, or engaged in reading the Scriptures, or any study of divine subjects that, ordinarily, I will not be interrupted by going to dinner, but will forego my dinner rather than be broke off. 

April 4, 1735. When at any time, I have a sense of any divine thing, then to turn it in my thoughts, to a practical improvement. As for instance, when I am in my mind, on some argument for the truth of religion, the reality of a future state, and the like, then to think with myself, how safely I may venture to sell all, for a future good. So when, at any time, I have a more than ordinary sense of the glory of the saints in another world; to think how well it is worth my while to deny myself, and to sell all that I have for this glory, etc. 

May 18. My mind at present is never to suffer my thoughts and meditations, at all to ruminate. 

June 11. To set apart days of meditation on particular subjects; as sometimes, to set apart a day for the consideration of the greatness of my sins; at another, to consider the dreadfulness and certainty of the future misery of ungodly men; at another, the truth and certainty of religion; and so, of the great future things promised and threatened in the Scriptures.
