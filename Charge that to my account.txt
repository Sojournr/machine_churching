- How are you doing today? Is everything good? Everything's good, right? That's what we say when people ask us how we're doing? How're things going? "Everything's good, man. It's all good." 
- So let's introspect for a minute. Is nothing missing from your life? Do you feel whole and complete? You're living for your perfect purpose, doing what you're meant to be doing? Your parents, children, spouse, family, friends... all relationships are fulfilling and you're at peace with everyone? Good, good... alright.
- Great, let's switch gears since your personal lives are so perfect and there's nothing to work with there. Let's extrospect now. Let's look out into the rest of the world and consider it. Do we like what we see? 
- Man, we can't even pretend about that, right? It's messed up out there. We can sometimes pretend that all's well for us personally, but there aren't many people who look out into the world and say, "Yeah, things are going great out there for everyone, everywhere. I'm so glad that there's peace in the Middle East, and that our President upholds the dignity of his office, and hey, at least we successfully re-united all those children who were separated from their families at the border." See, we can't even pretend about those things, because too many people know about them; it's too obvious.
- But I'm not going to ask what the problem is, I’m just going to tell you the answer, right up front, maybe we can make this realll quick today. 
- slide -
- Do you like that quote? “Today, there are three kinds of people:  the have’s, the have-not’s, and the have-not-paid-for-what-they-have’s.” 
- What if I said that the answer to what ails us, both personally and generally, is debt? But it's not that we already have too much of it, or that we desperately need to pay it off before the global economy collapses; it's actually that we don't have enough debt. 
- What if I said that what's missing from your life, and from my life, and from this world is just an overwhelming burden of debt? 
- Can you raise your hand if you agree with that? Raise your hand if what you need in your life is more debt? 
- Not a lot of takers, huh? Alright, I guess we won't wrap this up early then. It looks like we've got our work cut out for us today.
- slide -
- I'm going to do a very Paul like thing and give you a takeaway right up front. This one's a phrase and it's going to be interactive. Ready? Repeat after me: "Charge that to my account."
- Have you ever been out with a bunch of people at a restaurant, and you're celebrating something, and you're really excited, and in your enthusiasm you offer to pay for everyone? Yeah, you feel pretty big right then, right? You're all like, "Guys, I got this. This one's on me." And then you choke on your drink when the check arrives. Have you ever checked your bank account or your credit card on your phone before you paid the check? You're there trying to do it on the sly like you just had to check the score of the O's game before you slid your card in the slot of that little black book? They lost, by the way, there's no need to check. 
- Seriously, though, that's not a fun feeling. It does not feel good to owe something that you might not be able to pay. Personally, I don't want to owe anything to anybody that I can't pay right now.
- We're not really supposed to have debt, right? I mean the bible doesn't say "never take out a loan". 
- slide -
- But in general, borrowing seems frowned upon. Proverbs 22:7 says, "The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is the slave of the lender." And in verse 26, "Be not one of those who give pledges, who put up security for debts." 
- slide -
- Or this one, from Nehemiah, chapter 5, "There were also those who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get grain because of the famine.” And there were those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards. Now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children are as their children. Yet we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but it is not in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our vineyards.”
- These proverbs and passages don't exactly paint debt in a good light. But maybe there's more to it than that?
- slide -
- How about an example from history? Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Treasury secretary, wrote in 1781 that, "A national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing; it will be powerfull cement of our union." By which he meant that it would bind us together as a nation and that it would wrap our success up with the rest of the world and make our bonds appealing to them.
- slide -
- On the flip side... any debt, national, or more to the point, personal, that does become excessive, by which I mean un-payable... that kind of debt binds us. It doesn't bind us to each other, it just binds us, it constricts us, it limits us, right?
- None of us here today, myself included, wants to take on anything that could be considered an "excessive debt"
- Some of us have found ourselves in situations that we have come to regret due to spending excessively. It might be a house, a car, even a vacation.
- Whatever it is, the effect is the same, a whole lot of stress, and a loss of freedom. Excessive debt prevents us from being free to do as we will.
- slide -
- So, it's one thing to cover a dinner, but it's another thing to pay off someone's debt owed due to reckless spending, no one's jumping up to say "charge that to my account"...
- Except that you parents out there, you're thinking that you might... right? We've been there... I mean not me, not my kids, they're perfect
- But me, personally? I know that my mom once paid a $700 phone bill back when you had minutes and a certain number of text messages and could only talk at night or on the weekends and if you started a conversation one minute before the clock struck 8PM well then, the whole call counted against the minutes... Sorry, mom...
- So yeah, that happened, and it wasn't something that we could easily afford, but she found a way because parents are willing to pay to rescue their kids.
- Okay, so we agree, right? We know these things. Excessive debt is bad, we shouldn't enable people, parents love their children, we get it. 
- So, I hope you're thinking, "But you said that more debt is the answer. You said to write down 'charge that to my account'".
- Yep, and here's why: There are times when we need to be willing to owe more than we can pay for someone else's sake. There are times when that is right and it is good. We need to be willing to say, "charge that to my account", knowing full well that we might really have to pay and it might even be hard. If we're not at least *offering* to owe somebody something for someone else's sake, then maybe we're not doing it right, maybe we're missing out on something really good, something that can change the world. 
- Today, we're finishing our series on Colossians. And we're finishing it with Paul's letter to Philemon, which made it into this series because it was written at the same time as Colossians, and, because Philemon lived in Colossae, it was delivered at the same time, by the same people.
- Throughout the Bible, and maybe especially in Philemon, God shows us what it means to be willing to take on the debt of another, to be willing and ready to say "charge that to my account".
- And Philemon, just like my idea of more debt as a solution to our problems, is a letter full of contradictions. It's a tiny letter, 335 words, but it asks great, big questions. It's a letter written mostly to just one man and mostly about just one man, but it has impacted millions. Maybe most strangely, it is often credited as being critical ending the massive, worldwide institution of legal slavery, even though it was used both by abolitionists and pro-slavery forces.
- It can be read in just a few minutes, so let's take the time to do just that.
- slide -
Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.
- slide -
Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus—I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord. For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
- slide -
So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.

Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.
- slide -

Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
- slide -
- I said that it was full of contradictions, and the characters of the letter are no exception. Did you notice? Let's look at three of them: Paul, who wrote the letter; Philemon, who received the letter; and Onesimus, who delivered the letter.
- Onesimus is described as useless in verse 11, he is a lawbreaker in verse 18, and he is a slave in verse 16. Alternatively, he's a brother (Colossians 4:9), he is faithful (Colossians 4:9), and he is Paul's son (Philemon 10); Paul even says that he is his very own heart (verse 12).
- slide -
- Philemon is Paul's partner in the faith, he's a leader of the church that meets in his home, and very interestingly he's described as a rest-giver (Philemon 7 - the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.) refreshed in this context meaning "giving rest from hard labor". But, and this is what makes that word so interesting, he's also a slave-owner. He's a rest-giver and a slave owner. And there's a certain part of me that wants to say, "what does it matter if you are a partner in the faith, a leader of the church, and a man known as giving rest to the weary if you also own people as property". 
- So before we get to Paul, we should level-set our understanding of slavery in this context. And let me just say straight off that it makes me cringe to even qualify slavery in any way. But here goes.
- Slavery in ancient Rome was not like the slavery of America in that it was not race-based. It's been estimated that as much as one-third of the population of the ancient Roman empire was made up of slaves. So look to your left, and look to your right, and please *don't* think about who would be most likely to end up a slave. People in Rome became slaves as prisoners of war, or, maybe more commonly, as a result of being unable to pay their debts. In this case, they were often paid for their work, whatever the going wage was for what they did. And they also held roles that wouldn't be familiar to American slavery. There were slaves who were doctors or who were teachers, or who even owned other slaves. And slaves in Rome could earn their own freedom as a result of paying off their debt. But, let's be clear. They. Were. Still. Slaves. They did not have rights. They were recognized as property. And pertinent to this message: They could be "disciplined" up to and including execution for stealing from and running away from their master. That's the scenario that Onesimus is in with Philemon.
- slide -
- And last, but not least, there's Paul. And at the time he writes this letter, he's a prisoner, under house arrest in Rome. He is no free man himself and he really wants to let us know it. Prisoner in verse 1, Prisoner in verse 9, imprisoned in verse 13. At the same time though, he is also a father (v10), a brother (v20), and a partner (v17). 
- As the author of the letter, Paul seems like he's really embracing these contradictions. He makes himself low as a prisoner, rather than raising himself up high to the position of apostle. As an apostle he could command, but instead he chooses to appeal... and then there's this: 
- slide -
- Deuteronomy 23:15, a verse that Paul certainly knows. It says: "You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place that he shall choose within one of your towns, wherever it suits him. You shall not wrong him."
- But in his letter to Philemon, who is the owner of the runaway slave Onesimus, Paul says, "I am sending [Onesimus] back to you".
- Is this enough with the contradictions? Are we losing track of the things that don't add up or make sense? 
- Well, I'm sorry, but we need just one more. It's the contradiction that Paul uses to resolve all the rest. 
- slide -
- In a different letter, Paul wrote: "Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments... are summed up in this word: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself'". (Rom 13:8-9)
- So of course, what does Paul do? He literally and maybe even legally offers to put himself into debt for Onesimus's sake.
- slide -
- To whatever Onesimus owes, to whatever wrong he has done to Philemon, Paul says, "charge that to my account" and then, really putting his money where his mouth is, he writes, "I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it".
- This is the part that gets me. It gets me every time I read it. Because how often do we see this? In the world or in the church? Even if you could count the number of times that you've seen or experienced this the answer would be "Not enough". We don't see this enough.
- Do you remember how you ended up as a slave in ancient Rome? 1. Prisoner of war 2. Unable to pay your debts.
- So what does Paul do for Onesimus? He puts himself on the hook for a debt that someone else owes. He writes a contract that says it's his debt now. He is taking on the consequence of Onesimus's actions. 
- Remember, Paul's not likely to be flush with cash right now.  As he reminds Philemon over and over, he's a prisoner. He's taking a huge risk. What if Philemon decides, "you know what, I do want you to repay it"? And what if Paul can't repay? He's willing to go from prisoner to slave out of love for Onesimus.
- Who loves like this?! We need more of this! 
- Say it again with me: "Charge that to my account"
- People suffer today, churches suffer today, our society suffers today not because of debt owed, but because of a lack of debt owed. 
- We need to owe, and we need to offer to owe more to each other. Paul shows us the way.
- All the contradictions fall now like a house of cards. His act of love resolves it all.
- "Owe no one anything, except to love each other."
- Paul lives out his own command, putting himself in debt in order to show love to his neighbor.
- This debt of love, this act of love, explains not just how Paul can put himself into debt for a brother, but it also explains how he could send Onesimus back to Philemon. Love does no wrong to a neighbor. So he sent him back, but not alone, no. He sends him with a letter.
- Last week, we talked about Tychicus, about how he carried Paul's letters all over the world, about the responsibility, the gravity of that task. How grateful we are to him to still have these letters today. 
- Onesimus, on the other hand, he carries his own letter. It's a letter of forgiveness, of redemption, of ransom, of freedom, of salvation. More than that, it's a letter of identity. Onesimus gets his personhood back through this letter. He knows who he is because of this letter. He has a father now, Paul, who says that he begot Onesimus. 
- You want to know how I know that Onesimus would identify Paul as his father? The dad jokes. Do you want to see? These may be the very first Dad-Jokes of all time. 
- slide -
- They're the only ones I know of in the bible. They're so corny. These are some prime dad jokes. I'm gonna tell you and no one's going to laugh, that's how good they are. And because we all know that dad jokes aren't even understandable without context, I'll give you a little. Onesimus's name means useful, alright? It comes from the Greek word for profitable, okay? Watch what Paul does...
- Philemon 9 – 11: I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus—I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus (useful one), whose father I became in my imprisonment. (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)
- You know that when Paul wrote that line he laughed, slapped his knee and then showed it to Onesimus, whose eyes rolled right out of his head.
- And then, one more time, in verse 20. In English it says something like: "Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ." But in the Greek, the word translated benefit here, is the word for Profit. It's almost exactly Onesimus's name.
- You know what though? While these are pitch perfect Dad jokes, they're also more than that.
- While I was preparing for this message, it hit me that Onesimus is probably not this man's name by birth. I might be behind the curve in realizing that, because I bet most of the moms in the room recognized that that's not how they'd name their sons.
- "We'll call him Useful. I just know he's going to do all the chores."
- So Onesimus, then, is probably his slave name. It was a very common slave name. And he probably **hated** it. It was demeaning; it was dehumanizing. It reduced him to a unit of production. 
- How like our God, then, to redeem it for his purposes. Imagine, Onesimus loses his given name when he becomes a slave. Then, he rejects his slave name, Onesimus, Useful One, by stealing from Philemon and running away. There could not **be** a more Useless slave than a runaway thief. So, Paul turns the concept inside out and upside down, because Paul is able to witness to this runaway thief of a slave, and he comes to know and believe in and follow Jesus. And suddenly, he is Useful. Truly Useful, for the first time in his life. He is useful to his spiritual father, Paul, and he is useful to his heavenly Father as well. And for the first time since his enslavement began, he can embrace his new name. 
- It made me think too that in the bible, it sometimes happened that you would meet God and God would change your name to reflect your new life, because you're changed, one way or another when you meet him. And so, Abram became Abraham, and Sarai became Sarah. Jacob becomes Israel. Cephas becomes Peter and Saul, Paul. But Onesimus is much more like us. He meets God and he is changed forever, but instead of changing his name, he fulfills his name and becomes who he was always meant to be. It's a reminder to me that God is always at work in everything, even or especially in things that I don't like, and that his timing is not like my timing.
- So now, Onesimus and Tychicus carry this letter together to deliver it to Philemon. Imagine how he felt, carrying that letter with him across the 1300 miles of boat travel and roman roads, knowing that he was going to have to deliver it to - that he was going to have to face - Philemon again. I'm sure every time he thought of meeting Philemon over those many days of travel he felt dread in the pit of his stomach, but then he remembered the letter and I think I know how it made him feel.
- And eventually, after a couple of weeks of travel that probably felt like years, Onesimus and Tychicus arrive in Colossae and Onesimus comes face to face with Philemon and he's probably terrified, but he has this letter, and it would be sealed with Paul's personal seal and it's signed in Paul’s hand so that Philemon would know it's the real deal. And inside it says, "Onesimus is my child, my beloved child, my very own heart. Whatever he's done, whatever he owes, charge that to my account. I WILL REPAY IT." 
- Isn't this the gospel? Isn't this a picture of us? Haven't we all been separated from God (v15) and from our purpose, and made like Onesimus into a useless runaway slave? And then, just like he found Paul, we find Jesus, or he finds us, and what does he do? The first thing he does is to love us and help us just like Paul did for Onesimus. And then he gives us a letter, we each get a letter, too. 
- slide -
- Paul says to the Corinthians: "You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, recognized and read by everyone." 2 Cor 3:2 And just like Paul would have set his seal into the letter so that the recipient would know it was from him, Jesus seals us with the Spirit, just like it says in Ephesians: "In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit" Eph 1:13. 
- Do you know what the letter says? What *our letter* says? It doesn't just offer to pay; it says "I have paid it". I have paid for Kyle. I have paid for Maddy. I’ve paid for Jay. I’ve paid for you.
- slide -
- Paul wrote to the Colossians, saying: "And you, who were dead in your trespasses... God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, (HOW? How did he do that?) by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross." Colossians 2:13–14
- It frustrates me to no end that I can't stand here and tell you exactly, like play-by-play style, what happened when Onesimus read that letter to Philemon. I wish, I wish it was recorded. Why wouldn't they record that part? Did nobody have their phone on them?! I'd even accept portrait-oriented video... 
- But you know what. I'm sure that I do know what happened. I'm sure that everyone in this room who has given their life to Jesus and fallen in love with him knows what happened. Because when your debts are paid for, when that record is cancelled, when it's been nailed to the cross... you can only be free.
- slide -
- Jesus, like Paul, said to God, said *with* God, "charge that to my account". He. Paid. It. All.
- We could end there, but I really have one more thing I'd like to share. This is going to be, as one of our brothers likes to say, "rank speculation", so feel free to ignore this if you'd like. I said earlier that there's no way to know what became of Onesimus as a result of his conversation with Philemon, that it frustrates me that there's no play-by-play. But there is... something.
- slide -
- An early Christian, a man named Ignatius, wrote a letter to the church in Ephesus, about 100 miles away from Colossae where Philemon and Onesimus lived.
- And in the letter, which is about church unity and submission, and which it seems that he wrote on his way to martyrdom in Rome, there's this curious passage about how he met the Ephesian church's leader. 
- slide -
- It reads: "I received therefore your numerous body in the name of God in the person of Onesimus, whose love surpasses words, who is, besides, in the flesh your bishop. I pray that you may love him with a love according to Jesus Christ, and that you may all be like him."
- So, is this the very same Onesimus? The runaway slave turned beloved son of Paul and faithful brother in the faith? Is he now a leader of the church in Ephesus? We can't know. But the timing is right and it's just a fitting end to this story. I mean, I know that there would have been a lot of Onesimus's in that place and time. But they would likely have been slaves, so to become a bishop seems unlikely... it makes sense that it might be our Onesimus, the one who spent significant time with Paul during his imprisonment in Rome, who would have gone back to Paul in Rome if Philemon received his letter and did the "more than" Paul even asked. Who would be better prepared to be a bishop than someone who learned from Paul? And who else would have kept the name Onesimus on gaining his freedom. It just fits for it to be the Onesimus on whose behalf Paul wrote. And if that's right, then it's just a great example to us of what can become of us after our debts are forgiven, when we're made free. Whether or not this is *the Onesimus*, I'm sure that he made the most of his redemption, and so should we. 

- For us who know that we carry such a letter, who have had our debts cancelled, let's make the most of it. Let's, like Paul, offer to charge to our account whatever we can bear in order to help our neighbor. Let's do it out of love for our fellow man and out of love for God. Let's recognize that we owe a debt of love to each other, to every other human who is made in the image of God, to everyone we meet. And let’s be like Onesimus, about whom Ignatius wrote: “I pray that you may all be like him.” Let's live so that others might write or say of us: "[their] love surpasses words".
- Let's pray.
- **END**
