Introduction
The number and offices of the singers and players on musical instruments; and their division by lot into twenty-four courses, vv. 1-31.

Verse 1
David and the captains of the host - The chiefs of those who formed the several orders: not military captains.

Should prophesy - Should accompany their musical instruments with prayer and singing.

Verse 2
Which prophesied - Sung hymns and prayed. But the Targum understands this of prophesying in the proper sense of the term; and therefore says, “Who prophesied by the Holy Spirit.” Jarchi is of the same opinion and quotes the case of Elisha, 2 Kings 3:15; While the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord [i.e., the spirit of prophecy] was upon him.

Verse 3
The sons of Jeduthun - six - That is, six with their father, otherwise, there are but five. Hence it is said, they were under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, etc.

Verse 5
To lift up the horn - “The horn of prophecy,” says Jarchi; “to sound with the trumpet in the words of prophecy before the Lord.” - T.

Three daughters - These also were employed among the singers.

Verse 7
Two hundred fourscore and eight - That it twelve classes of twenty-four Levites each; for two hundred and eighty-eight divided by twelve quotes twenty-four.

Verse 9
For Asaph to Joseph - His first-born.

The second to Gedaliah - The first-born of Jeduthun.

Verse 10
The third to Zaccur - The first-born of Asaph.

Verse 11
The fourth to Izri - The second son of Jeduthun.

Verse 12
The fifth to Nethaniah - The third son of Asaph. Thus we find the lot did not run in any particular kind of order.

Verse 14
Jesharelah - Supposed to be the same with Uzziel, son of Heman.

Verse 31
Romamti-ezer - Both these names belong to the same person. He is mentioned also 1 Chronicles 25:4.
With this immense parade of noise and show, (David‘s own invention), Christianity has nothing to do.
