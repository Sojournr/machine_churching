Introduction
Solomon having finished the temple, brings in the things which his father had consecrated, 2 Chronicles 5:1. He assembles the elders and chiefs of Israel and the Levites, in order to bring up the ark from the city of David, 2 Chronicles 5:2, 2 Chronicles 5:3. They bring it and its vessels; and having offered innumerable sacrifices, place it in the temple, under the wings of the cherubim, 2 Chronicles 5:4-10. The Levites, singers, and trumpeters praise God; and his glory descends and fills the house, so that the priests cannot stand to minister, 2 Chronicles 5:11-14.

Verse 1
Brought in all the things - See the note on 1 Kings 7:51.

Verse 3
The feast - “That is, the feast of tabernacles, which was held in the seventh month.” - Targum. See 1 Kings 8:2.

Verse 9
They drew out the staves - As the ark was no longer to be carried about, these were unnecessary.

Verse 10
There was nothing in the ark save - The Chaldee paraphrases thus: “There was nothing put in the ark but the two tables which Moses placed there, after the first had been broken on account of the calf which they made in Horeb, and the two other tables had been confirmed which were written with writing expressed in the Ten Words.”

Verse 11
When the priests were come out - After having carried the ark into the holy of holies, before the sacred service had commenced.

Verse 12
A hundred and twenty priests - Cymbals, psalteries, and harps, of any kind, in union with a hundred and twenty trumpets or horns, could not produce much harmony; as to melody, that must have been impossible, as the noise was too great.

Verse 13
For he is good - This was either the whole of the song, or the burden of each verse. The Hebrew is very short: - 
כי טוב כי לעולם חסדו 
(Ki tob ki leolam chasdo).
For he is good; for his mercy is endless.

Verse 14
The priests could not stand - What a proof of the being of God, and of the Divine presence! What must those holy men have felt at this time!
