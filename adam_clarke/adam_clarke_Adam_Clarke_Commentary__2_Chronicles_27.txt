Introduction
Jotham succeeds his father Uzziah, and reigns well, 2 Chronicles 27:1, 2 Chronicles 27:2. His buildings, 2 Chronicles 27:3, 2 Chronicles 27:4. His successful wars, 2 Chronicles 27:5, 2 Chronicles 27:6. General account of his acts, reign, and death, 2 Chronicles 27:7-9.

Verse 2
He entered not into the temple - He copied his fatherâ€˜s conduct as far as it was constitutional; and avoided his transgression. See the preceding chapter, 2 Chronicles 26 (note).

Verse 3
On the wall of Ophel - The wall, says the Targum, of the interior palace. Ophel was some part of the wall of Jerusalem, that was most pregnable, and therefore Jotham fortified it in a particular manner.

Verse 4
Castles and towers - These he built for the protection of the country people against marauders.

Verse 5
He fought also with - the Ammonites - We find here that he brought them under a heavy tribute for three years; but whether this was the effect of his prevailing against them, is not so evident. Some think that they paid this tribute for three years, and then revolted; that, in consequence, he attacked them, and their utter subjection was the result.

Verse 7
The rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways - It was in his days, according to 2 Kings 15:37, that Rezin king of Syria, and Pekah king of Israel, began to cut Judah short. See the notes on 2 Kings 15:36, 2 Kings 15:37.

Written in the book of the kings, etc. - There is not so much found in the books of Kings which we have now, as in this place of the Chronicles. In both places we have abridged accounts only: the larger histories have long been lost. The reign of Jotham was properly the last politically prosperous reign among the Jews. Hezekiah and Josiah did much to preserve the Divine worship; but Judah continued to be cut short, till at last it was wholly ruined.
